    <string name="about">Final Jumper is game that resembles DoodleJump where the
    object is to jump from platform to platform.\n\nCharacter movement is controlled by
        the accelerometer (tilting your phone left/right).  For demo and testing purposes, the A and D keys may also be used for left and right movement.\n\nThe higher you jump, the higher the score. Good
        luck and Have Fun!!\n\nDevelopers:\nBrad Wilcox and Michael Cha</string>
